# JARVIS Light

**A local-first operating system for Codex continuity.**

Current version: `0.0.14`

Latest update: Company Mode v0.5.2 clarifies GitHub autonomy and requires explicit next-action language instead of vague "likely" wording.

JARVIS Light turns a folder of markdown files into durable assistant memory.  
It helps Codex work across long chats, fresh chats, projects, research, codebases, and handoffs without pretending the chat history itself is the source of truth.

It is inspired by the same continuity problem that Chronicle-style memory tries to solve, but it is intentionally different:

- no background screen capture
- no screenshots
- no always-on memory agent
- no hidden database requirement
- no transcript dumping
- no expensive automatic capture loop

JARVIS Light is **not a Chronicle replacement**.  
It is the lightweight/manual mode: local markdown, explicit retrieval, compact memory, and agent discipline.

## The One-Sentence Version

JARVIS Light makes Codex behave less like a fresh chat and more like an organized teammate that can read the project state, do the work, and leave the next session in a better position.

## Copy-Paste Starts

Use these prompts as starting points. Replace the project details and paths.

### 1. Normal Continuity Work

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS.

Read the relevant project memory first, then help me with:
...
```

### 2. Fresh-Chat Handoff

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS.

This chat is getting long. Create a fresh-chat handoff for this project.
Include current objective, completed work, blockers, exact next steps, and files the next chat should read first.
```

### 3. Refresh An Older Active Chat

Use this when JARVIS or Company Mode has been updated while an older project chat is still active.

```text
Jarvis, workflow refresh.

Read the latest installed JARVIS and JARVIS Company Mode skills before continuing:
- ~/.codex/skills/jarvis/SKILL.md
- ~/.codex/skills/jarvis-company-mode/SKILL.md

Then read this project's company/current-state.md and company/task-board.md.

Follow the latest workflow rules from now on, especially:
- role header on every Company Mode reply
- no passive acknowledgement; ok/yes/go/next/? should continue when unblocked
- Founder can evolve the team when needed
- roles should critique weak orders and propose better paths
- version changes must update visible docs
```

For long or messy threads, use a fresh-chat handoff instead of trying to keep the old chat alive.

```text
Jarvis, create a fresh-chat handoff for this project using the latest JARVIS workflow.
```

### 4. New App Or Product

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS and JARVIS Company Mode.

Start a new project in Company Mode.
Project idea:
...

Your first role is Founder.
Ask only setup questions that materially affect the project.
Choose the right workspace, create the team, and start with the highest-leverage first work orders.
```

### 5. Existing Repo Adoption

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS and JARVIS Company Mode.

Adopt this existing project into Company Mode:
/path/to/project

Your first role is Founder / Organizational Auditor.
Audit first, then create the company layer around the existing structure.
Do not reorganize or rewrite anything before the audit.
```

### 6. Research Project

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS and JARVIS Company Mode.

Start a research team for:
...

Your first role is Principal Investigator / Founder.
Clarify the research question, identify required roles, define methodology risks, and create the first work orders.
```

### 7. Data / Quant Project

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS and JARVIS Company Mode.

Start a data/quant project for:
...

Your first role is Founder.
Create roles for data engineering, modeling/statistics, validation, and reproducibility as needed.
Do not let anyone call results ready without verification and artifact hygiene.
```

### 8. Website Or Launch Page

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS and JARVIS Company Mode.

Build a serious website for:
...

Founder should include Product Designer, Frontend Engineer, Copy/Positioning, and Visual QA if useful.
The team should critique weak design or messaging without waiting for me to say "make it better."
```

### 9. Writing / Thesis / Book

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS and JARVIS Company Mode.

Create an editorial team for:
...

Founder should create roles for research, outline, drafting, critical review, and production editing as needed.
Keep citations, claims, and next writing tasks durable in markdown.
```

### 10. Bug Or Side Quest During Company Mode

```text
Jarvis, side quest for the current Company Mode project:
...

Classify this as clarification, defect, side quest, or scope change.
Preserve the interrupted task and tell me whether the main flow resumes afterward.
```

### 11. Keep Going Without Micromanaging

```text
ok
```

In an active Company Mode project, short acknowledgements such as `ok`, `yes`, `go`, `next`, or `?` should not produce passive replies. They should continue the next unblocked task or explain the exact blocker.

### 12. Force Innovation Mode

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS and JARVIS Company Mode.

For the next task, force Innovation Mode.
Generate meaningfully different options, critique them for value/risk/cost/originality/fit, then choose the best practical path.
Do not implement a risky or irreversible idea without creating a proposal or asking first.
```

Roles may also self-invoke Innovation Mode when the work is ambiguous, strategically important, creatively underdeveloped, expensive to reverse, or likely to become generic without deeper thinking.

### 13. Report Workflow Feedback

Use this when a real project exposes a reusable JARVIS / Company Mode improvement.

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS and JARVIS Company Mode.

Feedback for the workflow:
...

Record this as a feedback candidate.
Classify whether it is project-local or should be routed to JARVIS R&D.
Do not turn it into a standing rule until it is triaged.
```

### 14. Release / Version Update

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS and JARVIS Company Mode.

Run release readiness for this project.
Check verification, version metadata, README/changelog visibility, git status, and whether a PR or tag is needed.
Do not mark final acceptance without my approval.
```

## What Is Inside

JARVIS Light has two layers.

### 1. JARVIS Memory

The base layer:

- project memory
- personal preferences
- decision logs
- session notes
- handoffs
- artifact hygiene
- source-aware facts
- governed self-improvement

This is for continuity.

### 2. JARVIS Company Mode

The optional serious-project layer:

- Founder / Project Architect
- Chief of Staff
- specialist roles
- task board
- work orders
- role memories
- review gates
- internal critique
- out-of-box thinking
- adaptive team changes
- assertive role critique
- optional role names
- team roster for canonical role identity
- GitHub autonomy rules for role/task branches
- explicit next-action language
- selective innovation mode
- workflow feedback loop
- GitHub / PR workflow guidance
- adoption mode for existing projects

This is for projects where one undifferentiated agent would likely mix design, backend, frontend, QA, research, writing, and release work into one blurry pile.

## Why This Exists

Long Codex chats eventually become awkward:

- too much old context
- compaction noise
- repeated explanations
- lost project state
- unclear latest artifact
- agents saying “done” without enough durable trace

JARVIS Light changes the center of gravity:

```text
Chat = temporary working surface
Markdown vault = durable continuity layer
```

When the chat gets too long, you create a handoff and start fresh.

## What It Is

JARVIS Light is:

- a local markdown vault
- a Codex skill
- a set of templates and operating rules
- a low-token continuity workflow
- readable, editable, inspectable, private by default
- useful for coding, research, writing, planning, and long-running projects

JARVIS Light is not:

- a new chat app
- a model replacement
- an automatic memory recorder
- a screenshot/screen-observation tool
- a database-first knowledge system
- a place to dump full transcripts

## Core Ideas

### Markdown Is The Source Of Truth

Important state lives in `.md` files:

- what the project is
- what was decided
- what is blocked
- what was generated
- what is canonical
- what should happen next

Indexes or databases can be added later, but markdown remains canonical.

### Memory Should Preserve The Next Useful Action

Good memory is not a diary.

Save:

- decisions
- constraints
- current state
- exact next steps
- blockers
- artifact paths and validation
- durable preferences
- handoff context

Avoid:

- transcript dumps
- filler
- repeated summaries
- vague progress notes
- speculative thoughts that were not adopted

### Source-Aware Notes Reduce Fake Certainty

When provenance matters, label facts:

- `User-stated`
- `Observed in repo`
- `Tool result`
- `Agent inference`
- `External source`

Use labels only where they help. Do not turn every note into citation theater.

### Fresh-Chat Handoffs Are A Feature

Long chats are disposable. Project state is not.

When a thread gets long, create:

```text
handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-project-handoff.md
```

Then start a new chat with a short starter prompt that points to the right project note and handoff.

### Generated Artifacts Need Hygiene

Every meaningful output should answer:

- What is this?
- How was it made?
- Is it canonical, delivery, diagnostic, temporary, or superseded?
- How was it verified?
- What caveats remain?

The goal is not pretty documentation. The goal is not losing track of reality.

## Company Mode

Company Mode is optional. Use it when the project is big enough that specialist roles would help.

Examples:

- building an app
- adopting an existing codebase
- running a research project
- writing a book
- doing quant/data work
- preparing a serious website or product

### Greenfield Mode

Use this when starting from an idea.

The Founder asks only setup-level questions, then creates:

- project charter
- current state
- task board
- role charters
- role memories
- first work orders

Then you can mostly say:

```text
continue
status
show blockers
```

### Adoption Mode

Use this when the project already exists.

The Founder becomes **Founder / Organizational Auditor**:

1. Inspect the repo/folder first.
2. Create `company/adoption-audit.md`.
3. Separate observed facts from inferences and unknowns.
4. Infer roles from the actual project structure.
5. Add the Company Mode layer around the existing project.

Adoption Mode should not rewrite or reorganize the project before it understands it.

### Quality Bar

Company Mode should not stop at “it works.”

Roles should:

- aim for top-tier output for the project stage
- think out of the box
- challenge conventional assumptions
- critique weak orders and propose better paths
- identify weak parts before the user has to
- create improvement work orders when obvious gaps exist
- visually/materially verify user-facing artifacts
- wait for user approval before final acceptance

Founder and Chief of Staff can evolve the team as the project changes: hire new roles, merge redundant roles, retire completed roles, or add temporary specialists. Each role may also keep a short name alongside its title, such as:

```text
[Role: Product Designer | Name: Iris]
```

Role names are optional and file-backed. `company/team-roster.md` is the canonical source for role title, role name, status, scope, and header format. If a role has no name in the roster, the agent should use only `[Role: <Role Title>]` and must not invent a name from chat context.

Roles can also use Selective Innovation Mode. This is deeper than the normal out-of-box pass. It can be forced by the user or self-invoked by a role when a task deserves serious ideation. The role must state why it invoked the mode, compare meaningfully different options, critique them, and choose the best practical path.

Company Mode also supports a feedback loop for improving the workflow itself. When a project exposes reusable friction, a behavior defect, a missing rule, or a useful emergent pattern, the team can file a compact feedback candidate. A JARVIS R&D / maintainer team can then triage it as `reject`, `document-only`, `patch-skill`, `update-template`, `add-eval-scenario`, or `public-release`. Feedback candidates are not rules until promoted.

For coding projects, the workflow also supports:

- role/task branches
- role-authored commits
- PR handoffs
- version changes after reliable milestones

If the remote already exists, verification passed, and the current branch is a role/task branch, agents may push the branch and open/update a PR without asking first. They should still ask before pushing directly to `main`, merging, publishing releases/tags/packages, changing remotes/settings, force-pushing, deleting branches, or pushing anything that may contain private data.

Completion reports should use explicit next-action language:

- `Next task:` for unblocked continuation
- `Blocked:` for concrete blockers
- `Decision needed:` for consequential user choices
- `Ready for review:` for artifacts awaiting user review

Example commit author:

```bash
git commit --author="JARVIS Frontend Engineer <your-verified-email@example.com>" -m "Polish task filtering UI"
```

## Quick Start

1. Copy this repository to a local folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<you>/jarvis-light.git ~/JARVIS
   cd ~/JARVIS
   ```

2. Install the base JARVIS skill:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills/jarvis
   cp codex-skill/jarvis/SKILL.md ~/.codex/skills/jarvis/SKILL.md
   ```

3. Optional: install Company Mode:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills/jarvis-company-mode
   cp codex-skill/jarvis-company-mode/SKILL.md ~/.codex/skills/jarvis-company-mode/SKILL.md
   ```

4. Start Codex from the vault folder.

5. For normal continuity work:

   ```text
   Jarvis, use JARVIS. Read the relevant project memory first.
   ```

6. For Company Mode examples, use the copy-paste starts near the top of this README.

## Operating Loop

For meaningful work, the agent should:

1. understand the request,
2. identify the project/domain,
3. read the relevant memory,
4. execute the task,
5. verify the result,
6. update the smallest durable note,
7. create a handoff only when continuation would otherwise be lossy.

In Company Mode:

1. Chief of Staff reads current state and task board.
2. It picks the next unblocked task.
3. The assigned role executes.
4. The role runs verification and an out-of-box pass.
5. The company updates task board, role memory, and integration log.
6. Work continues until user approval, a real blocker, or a deliberate pause.

## End-of-Task Memory Check

Before finishing meaningful work:

- Did project state change?
- Was a durable decision made?
- Did a stable preference appear?
- Is there unfinished work or a blocker?
- Is a fresh-chat handoff needed?
- Was a generated artifact verified?
- Did this reveal a reusable lesson or failure pattern?

If not, do not write memory just to write memory.

## Suggested First Setup

1. Edit `memory/personal/preferences.md`.
2. Edit `memory/projects/index.md`.
3. Create one project note from `templates/project-memory.md`.
4. Keep `AGENTS.md` as the root operating rule file.
5. Install only the skills you actually want to use.

## Publishing Your Own Fork

Do not publish your private working vault directly unless you have reviewed it for secrets and personal information.

Recommended pattern:

- private live vault for real memory
- public sanitized template repo for reusable workflow
- copy improvements from private to public only after removing personal context

## License

No license is included in this template by default. Add the license you want before publishing for broad reuse.
