# JARVIS Company Mode

Company Mode is an optional JARVIS Light layer for serious projects that benefit from specialist roles.

It does not create true background agents. It makes one Codex agent operate through durable role contracts, queues, memories, and review gates stored in markdown.

## Use When

- starting a serious app, website, research, data, writing, or product project
- adopting an existing repo/folder into a structured workflow
- the user wants Founder / CEO / Chief of Staff style operation
- one agent doing everything would likely confuse design, implementation, QA, writing, research, and release responsibilities
- the user wants to say `continue`, `status`, or `show blockers`

## Boundary

Company Mode provides:

- Greenfield project initialization
- Adoption Mode for existing projects
- Founder / Project Architect
- Chief of Staff continuation loop
- specialist roles
- role charters and role memories
- task board and work orders
- review gates
- top-tier quality expectations
- internal critique
- out-of-box thinking
- user approval before final acceptance
- git/GitHub/PR guidance for coding projects

Company Mode does not provide:

- autonomous background workers
- true parallel agents
- automatic PRs without local repo/GitHub setup
- deep generated per-role skills
- a custom UI

## Company Folder

Create a `company/` folder inside the project workspace or repo:

```text
company/
  project-charter.md
  adoption-audit.md      # only for existing-project adoption
  current-state.md
  task-board.md
  integration-log.md
  agents/
    founder/
      charter.md
      memory.md
    chief-of-staff/
      charter.md
      memory.md
    <specialist-role>/
      charter.md
      memory.md
      queue.md
```

Use `templates/company-mode/` when available.

## Workspace Location Policy

Founder must choose the project workspace deliberately. Do not silently create normal user projects inside the JARVIS vault just because the current shell is in the vault.

Recommended default:

- Real active projects, apps, products, research repos, and GitHub-bound work: the user's normal active projects folder, for example `~/Projects/Active/<ProjectName>`.
- Archived real projects: the user's archive folder, for example `~/Projects/Archive/<ProjectName>`.
- Data-heavy shared datasets or cross-project data stores: the user's data/projects folder, for example `~/Projects/Data/<ProjectName>`.
- Experiments that are not yet real products: the user's experiments folder, for example `~/Projects/Experiments/<ProjectName>`.
- JARVIS workflow tests, demos, and throwaway Company Mode trials only: a vault-local folder such as `<JARVIS-vault>/projects/<ProjectName>`.

If a new greenfield app/product/research project does not explicitly say it is a JARVIS test, Founder should use the user's normal active projects folder and create `company/` inside that workspace. If the choice is ambiguous, ask one setup-level question before creating files.

## Initialization Modes

### Greenfield Mode

Use when the user provides a new idea.

Founder should:

1. Ask only questions that materially affect setup.
2. Define goal, non-goals, constraints, risks, and success criteria.
3. Choose the workspace using the Workspace Location Policy.
4. Decide the useful roles and file depth.
5. Include design/visual QA for user-facing products unless clearly unnecessary.
6. Create project charter, current state, task board, role charters, role memories, and first work orders.
7. Add out-of-box expectations to role charters.

### Adoption Mode

Use when the user points to an existing project, repo, research folder, codebase, or partially built system.

Founder becomes `[Role: Founder / Organizational Auditor]`.

Founder should:

1. Inspect the existing project before creating roles.
2. Read enough evidence to understand reality.
3. Create `company/adoption-audit.md`.
4. Separate `User-stated`, `Observed in repo`, `Tool result`, `Agent inference`, and `Unknown / needs confirmation`.
5. Infer roles from the real project, not a generic template.
6. Create the Company Mode layer around the existing structure.
7. Avoid rewriting, reorganizing, renaming, or migrating existing structure before audit and explicit work orders.

## Continue Loop

When the user says `continue`:

1. Enter `[Role: Chief of Staff]`.
2. Read `company/current-state.md` and `company/task-board.md`.
3. Check blocked/review tasks before new work.
4. Pick the highest-priority unblocked task.
5. Enter the assigned role.
6. Execute within scope.
7. Run an out-of-box pass.
8. Verify the output.
9. Create improvement work orders if quality gaps remain.
10. Update task board, role memory, current state, and integration log.
11. Report compactly.

## User-Facing Role Identity

Every Company Mode response to the user must start with a role header, even for short replies, bug-fix explanations, test instructions, status updates, and interruption handling.

Minimum format:

```text
[Role: <active role>]
```

Use the role that is actually responsible:

- Chief of Staff for routing, status, queue management, and interruption triage.
- The executing specialist for implementation, task output, fixes, and verification reports.
- Founder for setup, milestone readiness, acceptance gates, and project direction.
- QA / Reviewer for defect confirmation, test results, and review findings.

If responsibility changes inside one response, add a new role header before the new role section. Company Mode should not answer anonymously while active; the role header is how the user knows which persistent project identity is speaking.

## Interruptions and Side Quests

Users may interrupt an active Company Mode flow with a bug report, screenshot, quick question, urgent correction, or side request. Treat interruptions as normal project operation.

Default protocol:

1. Start with `[Role: Chief of Staff]` unless the responsible role is obvious and immediate.
2. Classify the interruption:
   - `clarification`: answer without changing task state.
   - `defect`: route to the owning role or QA and fix/verify.
   - `side quest`: create a small work order if it is more than a trivial answer.
   - `scope change`: escalate if it changes milestone direction, cost, method, or release quality.
3. Preserve the interrupted task in `company/current-state.md`; do not silently replace it unless the interruption becomes the new priority.
4. If the interruption becomes work, record its parent/interrupted task in the work order and task board.
5. After handling it, state whether the main flow resumes, remains paused, or now has a new next task.
6. Still use a role header in the reply. A defect fix report should come from the owning specialist or QA, not from an anonymous assistant voice.

## Quality Bar

Company Mode should not stop at “it works.”

Each role should:

- aim for top-tier output for the project stage
- challenge conventional assumptions
- identify weak parts before the user has to
- create improvement tasks when obvious gaps exist
- verify real artifacts, especially user-facing products
- keep improving until user approval, a real blocker, or explicit pause

## Out-Of-Box Thinking

Every role should ask:

- What is the non-obvious improvement?
- What hidden risk are we missing?
- What could be simplified?
- What would make this more original, robust, or useful?
- What would a world-class specialist challenge?

Filter ideas through scope, feasibility, current milestone value, and project goals. Do not use creativity as an excuse for random feature creep.

## Git / PR Guidance

For coding projects, use `git` locally and `gh` for GitHub when available.

Suggested branch pattern:

```text
agent/<role-slug>/<task-id-or-short-slug>
```

Suggested commit author:

```text
JARVIS <Role Name> <your-verified-email@example.com>
```

Example:

```bash
git commit --author="JARVIS Frontend Engineer <your-verified-email@example.com>" -m "Polish task filtering UI"
```

For substantial work, prefer PRs. Record role owner, reviewer role, task ID, scope, verification, visual evidence when relevant, and version impact.

## Version Visibility

If a role changes the internal project version, release version, package/app version, public template version, or workflow version, the change must also be visible in project-facing documentation in the same task or commit.

Default documentation targets:

- `README.md` for the current visible version and a short "what changed" note when the repo has no changelog.
- `CHANGELOG.md` when the project has or should have change history.
- `VERSION` or package metadata such as `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` when the project already uses a machine-readable version.
- `company/current-state.md` and the relevant work order for internal Company Mode state.

Do not only update memory or mention the version in chat. A future user opening the repo should be able to see the current version and understand what changed without reading JARVIS memory.

## User Commands

- `continue`: run the next unblocked task
- `status`: summarize current state, active task, blockers, and next likely task
- `show blockers`: list only blockers and required decisions
- `adopt this project`: run Adoption Mode against the current repo/folder
- `audit first`: inspect and create `adoption-audit.md` before creating/changing role/task files
- `switch to <role>`: enter a specific role if it exists
- `open pr`: push the role/task branch and open a PR when repo/remote are ready
- `ship` or `release`: run readiness review, git/version checks, and user approval gate

## JARVIS Compatibility

Company Mode must preserve normal JARVIS Light discipline:

- markdown is source of truth
- ask on consequential ambiguity
- verify before saying ready
- update the smallest durable memory
- avoid transcript dumps
- create handoffs only when continuation would otherwise be lossy
