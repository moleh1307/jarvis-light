# Adaptive Operating Patterns

Use this reference when Company Mode must decide how to shape a project, how much structure to create, how to label confidence, whether to run adversarial review, and when to re-rank the queue.

These are general operating patterns, not project-type recipes. Do not hardcode "math projects need X" or "apps need Y." Infer the project's needs from the user's goal, the observed project, the risk profile, and the success bar.

## Project-Shape Inference

Before Founder creates the company layer for a serious project, write a compact Project-Shape Inference. This can live in `project-charter.md` for greenfield work or `adoption-audit.md` for existing projects.

Answer proportionally:

- What kind of work is this?
- What makes success hard?
- What would failure look like?
- What evidence, artifacts, or outputs matter?
- What roles or disciplines are needed?
- What should not be overbuilt?
- What confidence lanes are needed?
- What verification or adversarial review gates are justified?
- Is a task board enough, or does the project need a strategy map, evidence ledger, attack tree, calibration pack, or similar artifact?

For simple projects, this may be five bullets. For complex research, product, data, writing, strategy, or architecture projects, it can be fuller.

## Confidence Lanes

Use confidence lanes when a project has claims, hypotheses, results, designs, data outputs, architecture decisions, or public statements that can vary in certainty.

Recommended lanes:

- `verified`: checked by tool, source, proof, test, or review.
- `working-assumption`: currently useful but not fully proven.
- `speculative`: useful for exploration, not stable project truth.
- `needs-audit`: important enough that another role should attack it.
- `rejected`: considered and ruled out; keep only if the reason matters.

Do not turn every trivial note into a confidence table. Use lanes where future agents could otherwise mistake a guess for fact.

## Optional Strategy Artifacts

A task board tracks work. A strategy map tracks why the work matters and how routes relate.

Create optional artifacts only when useful:

- `company/strategy-map.md`: hard, uncertain, multi-route, or long-horizon projects.
- `company/evidence-ledger.md`: projects with sources, claims, data, methodology, legal/financial/medical risk, research claims, or public assertions.
- `company/adversarial-review.md`: consequential results that need a hostile check before acceptance.

Project-specific names are allowed when clearer, such as `attack-tree.md`, `claims-map.md`, `design-calibration.md`, or `release-risk-review.md`.

## Adversarial Review Trigger

When a role produces a consequential internal result, trigger adversarial review or explicitly record why review is skipped.

Examples:

- proof claim -> proof audit;
- major design direction -> design critique;
- data result -> reproducibility/validation audit;
- architecture choice -> failure-mode review;
- method choice -> methodology review;
- release candidate -> release/QA audit;
- public claim -> source/fact check.

The review should try to break the result, not rubber-stamp it.

Review output should state:

- claim/result under review;
- confidence lane before review;
- strongest attack;
- defects found;
- surviving claim after review;
- new confidence lane;
- next work order if needed.

## Queue Re-Ranking

After meaningful work, Chief of Staff should ask:

- Did the last result change the bottleneck?
- Did a claim become important enough to audit?
- Did an old work order become obsolete or lower priority?
- Is the next task still the highest-leverage task?
- Should the team create a new review, integration, cleanup, or strategy work order before continuing?

If the bottleneck changed, update `task-board.md`, `current-state.md`, and relevant work orders. Do not blindly execute old numbered tasks just because they were already queued.

## Artifact Contract

For major artifacts, define enough of the contract up front:

- purpose;
- audience;
- canonical status;
- confidence lane;
- verification needed;
- acceptance bar;
- expiry or supersession rule.

This prevents random files from becoming accidental "final" outputs.

## Proportionality

These patterns are meant to reduce confusion, not create ceremony.

Use the lightest structure that preserves the next useful action:

- Tiny task: skip Company Mode.
- Simple Company Mode project: one-line shape inference, normal task board, no optional artifacts.
- Serious uncertain project: shape inference, confidence lanes, strategy map, and adversarial review for consequential results.
- Long-horizon project: periodic compression of current state, dead ends, live artifacts, and next attacks.
