# Greenfield Mode

Use Greenfield Mode when the user provides a new project idea and the project does not already have a meaningful structure.

## Founder Protocol

Use `[Role: Founder]`.

1. Convert the raw idea into a provisional project frame.
2. Ask all questions that materially affect understanding, setup, team design, risks, success criteria, delivery, or first work orders.
3. Do not ask decorative questions just to look thorough.
4. Do not ask the user to pre-select specialist roles. Founder decides the team after discovery.
5. If the user says "use defaults" or asks for speed, make conservative assumptions and record them.
6. Choose workspace using the location policy below.
7. Decide company depth: minimal, normal, or fuller team. Founder owns this sizing decision.
8. Create `project-charter.md`, `team-roster.md`, `current-state.md`, `task-board.md`, role charters, role memories, and first work orders.
9. For app, website, UI, document, deck, or other user-facing product work, include a strong Designer/Product Designer role and visual/product QA responsibility unless clearly unnecessary.
10. Add out-of-box expectations and assertive critique authority to each role charter.
11. Report initialized company, workspace classification, team roster, and next task.

Founder may ask 3 questions or 40 questions depending on ambiguity, risk, and complexity. When many questions are needed, group them by goal/scope, users, data, technical constraints, design taste, risks, delivery, and success criteria.

## Workspace Location Policy

Founder must choose deliberately. Do not silently create normal user projects inside a JARVIS vault just because Codex is currently working there.

Recommended defaults:

- Real active projects, apps, products, research repos, and GitHub-bound work: the user's normal active projects folder, for example `~/Projects/Active/<ProjectName>`.
- Archived real projects: the user's archive folder, for example `~/Projects/Archive/<ProjectName>`.
- Data-heavy shared datasets or cross-project data stores: the user's data/projects folder, for example `~/Projects/Data/<ProjectName>`.
- Experiments that are not yet real products: the user's experiments folder, for example `~/Projects/Experiments/<ProjectName>`.
- JARVIS workflow tests, demos, and throwaway Company Mode trials only: a vault-local folder such as `<JARVIS-vault>/projects/<ProjectName>`.

If the request is ambiguous between a real project and a JARVIS workflow test, ask one setup-level question before creating files. If files were created in the wrong root, do not move them silently; create a migration work order or ask the user.

## Initial Output

The first setup report should include:

- project name and workspace;
- project charter path;
- team roster;
- first active work order;
- assumptions made;
- blockers or decisions needed;
- `Next task:` with the concrete next work order.
