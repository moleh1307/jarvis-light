# Innovation Mode And Workflow Feedback

Use this reference for deep brainstorming, out-of-box thinking, and workflow feedback candidates.

## Selective Innovation Mode

Innovation Mode is deeper thinking for tasks where ordinary execution would likely produce generic, shallow, or locally optimal work.

Triggers:

- User-forced: the user asks for brainstorming, Innovation Mode, deep thinking, unique ideas, out-of-box ideas, or innovation.
- Role-invoked: a role decides the task deserves deeper ideation because of uncertainty, quality risk, strategic importance, creative upside, weak prior direction, or high reversal cost.

Use it when:

- product/design quality is weak, generic, or undifferentiated;
- there are many plausible approaches;
- the current plan feels conventional or low-leverage;
- the user asks for "make it better";
- project direction may be wrong;
- research method may be too narrow;
- implementation architecture will be hard to undo;
- there is a chance for a differentiated feature, method, or workflow.

Skip it for simple bug fixes, obvious small implementation, mechanical docs, urgent verification, speed-focused tasks, or blockers that brainstorming cannot resolve.

Required format when invoked:

```text
Innovation Mode: invoked / user-forced / skipped
Reason:
Problem:
Options:
1. Safe path
2. High-quality conventional path
3. Unusual but practical path
4. Bold differentiated path
5. Simplest path
Critique:
- value / risk / cost / originality / fit
Decision:
Action:
```

Implement the chosen path only when within scope and not consequentially risky. If too risky, expensive, irreversible, security-sensitive, method-changing, or release-quality-changing, create a proposal/work order and escalate.

## Compact Out-Of-Box Pass

When full Innovation Mode is not needed, each role still asks:

- What is the non-obvious improvement?
- What hidden risk are we missing?
- What could be simplified?
- What would make this more original, robust, or useful?
- What would a world-class specialist challenge?

Filter ideas through scope, feasibility, current milestone value, and project goals.

## JARVIS R&D Feedback Loop

Create feedback when a project reveals:

- behavior defect, such as passive acknowledgement, missing role identity, poor continuation, or bad routing;
- repeated workflow friction;
- missing role, rule, template field, or review gate;
- quality gap Company Mode should have caught;
- emergent pattern worth reusing;
- candidate eval scenario from real project interaction.

Use feedback sparingly. Do not file feedback for every one-off inconvenience or task-specific bug.

Feedback flow:

1. Project role records a compact feedback report in the project `company/` folder or work order.
2. Chief of Staff labels it `feedback-candidate`, not a new rule.
3. If it affects the JARVIS workflow itself, route to the maintainer/R&D project.
4. Maintainers triage as `reject`, `document-only`, `patch-skill`, `update-template`, `add-eval-scenario`, or `public-release`.
5. Only promoted feedback changes installed skills, public templates, README, or version numbers.

Feedback report should answer:

- What happened?
- Where did it happen?
- Why did workflow fail or succeed?
- Is this one-off, repeated, or high-impact?
- What change is proposed?
- What risk does the change introduce?
- How should it be verified?
