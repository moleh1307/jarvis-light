# Reference Router

Use this reference before loading deeper JARVIS OS references when a task could match several workflows. Its job is routing, not execution.

The router keeps `SKILL.md` short while making reference selection explicit. It should reduce prompt bloat, stale refresh prompts, and missed workflow gates.

## Routing Principles

- Route by the user's intent, the project operating mode, artifact risk, and escalation boundaries.
- Load the smallest reference bundle that can guide the next action correctly.
- Combine references only when the work genuinely spans them.
- Prefer the highest-consequence route first: safety, public release, private data, destructive action, and major claims outrank normal continuation.
- Stop reading once the selected route is enough to act. Do not load every reference for confidence theater.
- If the selected route exposes a wrong frame, generic output, skipped evidence, or stale state, run Stop-the-Line Review from `continuation.md`.

## Fast Router

| Trigger | Load first | Add when needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Long chat, compaction, resume, interruption, repeated `continue`, or risk that JarvisOS features are being forgotten | `runtime-anchor.md` | the specific reference selected after the anchor questions |
| Multiple skills apply, named skills overlap, or a domain/plugin skill must be combined with JarvisOS continuity | `skill-composition.md` | the lead skill's `SKILL.md`, then only the narrow JarvisOS/domain references needed |
| Clear task type but too many possible rules to synthesize | `task-cards.md` | the specific deeper reference named by the selected card |
| Serious/fresh/complex task where execution context is scattered across state, work orders, skills, tools, references, and verification | `agent-work-pack.md` | `task-cards.md`, `task-lifecycle.md`, `capability-surface.md`, or domain reference named by the pack |
| Creating, routing, reviewing, blocking, or closing a work order | `task-lifecycle.md` | `continuation.md` for closeout integrity |
| Repeated project-local workflow, "living/evolving project agents", local project skill, project-specific procedure, or team wants to learn from repeated project mistakes | `project-skill-incubator.md` | `skill-quality-standard.md`, `task-lifecycle.md`, `self-improvement-reflexes.md` |
| Continuous improvement, product R&D, workflow R&D, or idea-by-idea loop | `rd-idea-loop.md` | `innovation-feedback.md`, `task-lifecycle.md` when accepted ideas become work |
| Reusable behavior signal, self-improvement candidate, agent learning, memory metabolism, or "alive" workflow behavior | `self-improvement-reflexes.md` | `rd-idea-loop.md` when promoted; `memory-discipline.md` when writing durable memory |
| `JarvisOS Skill Ticket`, cross-project contribution, "make this a JarvisOS feature", reusable discovery from another chat, or skill/skillset extraction from chat history | `cross-project-contributions.md` | `skill-quality-standard.md` for skill drafts/reviews; `self-improvement-reflexes.md`, `rd-idea-loop.md`, `skill-creator` only after approval |
| Creating, reviewing, accepting, or implementing a JarvisOS skill, skillset, or skill-ticket draft | `skill-quality-standard.md` | `cross-project-contributions.md` for ticket routing; `skill-creator` only after approval |
| "What did JARVIS learn?", learning readout, reflex summary, recent self-improvement status | `learning-pulse.md` | `self-improvement-reflexes.md` if new candidates should be captured |
| Older active chat needs latest workflow | `workflow-refresh.md` | `continuation.md`, `roles-and-roster.md` |
| Durable memory write, stale memory conflict, long project note, handoff, project-note split, memory cleanup | `memory-discipline.md` | `continuation.md` for closeout or handoff |
| `continue`, `go`, `next`, short approval, status, blocker, interruption | `continuation.md` | `adaptive-operating-patterns.md` for queue re-ranking or claim review |
| New serious project or unclear project shape | `greenfield.md` | `adaptive-operating-patterns.md`, `roles-and-roster.md`, domain-specific quality references |
| Existing repo/project takeover | `adoption-takeover.md` | `github-release-versioning.md`, `quality-qa-and-critique.md` |
| Tool-dependent work, plugin/tool use, local app/browser/imagegen/GitHub/deploy/email capability, or verification boundary | `capability-surface.md` | `quality-qa-and-critique.md`, `github-release-versioning.md`, domain reference |
| Role headers, team changes, roster drift | `roles-and-roster.md` | `continuation.md` for response preflight |
| Research, data, proof, architecture, strategy, or consequential claims | `adaptive-operating-patterns.md` | `quality-qa-and-critique.md` |
| Excellence-critical non-visual output | `adaptive-operating-patterns.md` | `quality-qa-and-critique.md`, `innovation-feedback.md` |
| User-facing app/site/product with visual quality risk | `creative-preproduction.md` | `visual-concept-pipeline.md`, `quality-qa-and-critique.md` |
| Concrete UI concept, screenshot, mockup, or generated design target | `visual-concept-pipeline.md` | `creative-preproduction.md` for art direction |
| Small public-facing artifact: personal site, public email, README, bio, one-pager, deployed static site | `public-artifacts.md` | `creative-preproduction.md` or `visual-concept-pipeline.md` if craft-critical |
| QA, rendered checks, package smoke, internal critique, artifact readiness | `quality-qa-and-critique.md` | `continuation.md` for closeout integrity |
| GitHub, PR, branch, first push, release, version, changelog, public repo readiness | `github-release-versioning.md` | `continuation.md` for closeout integrity |
| Workflow feedback, new rule proposal, deep brainstorm, R&D improvement | `innovation-feedback.md` | `continuation.md` for off-roadmap proposal gate |
| Generic, stale, wrong, misleading, repeated-failure, or low-quality momentum | `continuation.md` | the domain reference that should own the correction |

## Core-Only Cases

Stay in the main `SKILL.md` without deeper Specialist Mode references when the task is ordinary JARVIS Core work:

- answer a simple question from current context;
- inspect or update one memory note;
- create a small handoff from already-known state;
- make a narrow code or docs edit in a normal project;
- run a simple command or explain a local artifact.

If the task becomes consequential, public-facing, long-running, or role-governed, route again.

## Routing Procedure

1. If context is long, compacted, resumed, interrupted, or JarvisOS behavior may be drifting, read `runtime-anchor.md` first.
2. Identify whether the message contains an actual task. If the user only invokes JARVIS OS with no task, mode, project, or target, stay in the main skill's bare-invocation mode chooser and ask whether to use Core or Specialist Mode.
3. Identify the active mode: JARVIS Core or Specialist Mode.
4. If Specialist Mode is requested, identify the exact target project/workflow before routing deeper. Ask when the target is ambiguous; do not default to JARVIS R&D just because the workspace is the JARVIS vault, `company/` exists, or the user also says `JARVIS OS`.
5. Identify the request class: continue, initialize, adopt, build, research, public artifact, visual craft, release, QA, workflow feedback, or recovery.
6. Use `skill-composition.md` when multiple skills apply and the lead/support boundary is not obvious.
7. Use `task-cards.md` when a compact task-type checklist is enough to start safely.
8. Use `agent-work-pack.md` when a task-local brief would reduce over-reading or scattered execution context.
9. Use `task-lifecycle.md` when durable work-order state, risk lane, blocker, evidence, or done status is being changed.
10. Use `rd-idea-loop.md` when the task is explicitly running an idea loop, continuous improvement loop, product R&D loop, or workflow R&D loop.
11. Use `self-improvement-reflexes.md` when the task is about active learning, candidate capture, memory metabolism, or making JARVIS feel more alive without silent rule mutation.
12. Use `cross-project-contributions.md` when another JarvisOS chat/project should create a `JarvisOS Skill Ticket` or package a reusable discovery, proposed feature, or candidate skill/skillset for R&D review.
13. Use `skill-quality-standard.md` when the task creates, proposes, reviews, or implements a skill, skillset, or skill-ticket draft.
14. Use `learning-pulse.md` when the task is to make recent learning visible without changing standing behavior.
15. Select the smallest deeper reference bundle from the table when the card exposes higher risk or missing detail.
16. Read only the selected references and the live project state needed for the next action.
17. Execute or propose according to the selected route.
18. If the route was wrong, run Stop-the-Line Review and switch route.

## Conflict Rules

- If a task is both public-facing and visual, start with `public-artifacts.md` for audience/trust/privacy, then use `creative-preproduction.md` or `visual-concept-pipeline.md` for craft.
- If multiple skills apply, use `skill-composition.md` to choose the lead skill before loading deep domain references.
- If a task is tool-dependent or verification-heavy, load `capability-surface.md` early enough to declare available tools, approval lane, and verification path before execution or closeout.
- If a task changes durable memory and also executes project work, do the project work first, then use `memory-discipline.md` for the smallest correct continuity update.
- If a task is both release-related and implementation-related, start with the implementation reference, then run `github-release-versioning.md` before reporting readiness.
- If a task is both research/proof and public-facing, use `adaptive-operating-patterns.md` for confidence lanes before public wording.
- If the user asks for a workflow change while a project is active, use `innovation-feedback.md` and `continuation.md` so the side quest is proposed or tracked without losing the active task.
- If a named external resource, URL, screenshot, repo, skill, or PDF is part of the request, inspect it or state why it is inaccessible before calling the route complete.

## Closeout

For meaningful Specialist Mode work, the selected route should still end through `continuation.md` closeout checks:

- state files agree with the report;
- docs/version/git/artifacts match reality;
- blockers and options reflect actual autonomy boundaries;
- the next task is concrete, created, assigned, or started unless truly blocked.
