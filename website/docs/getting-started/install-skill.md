# Install The Skill

The installable skill lives in:

```text
codex-skill/jarvis-os/
```

Copy it into your Codex skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R codex-skill/jarvis-os ~/.codex/skills/jarvis-os
```

Restart or open a fresh Codex chat, then invoke it:

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS OS.
```

## What The Skill Contains

The skill includes:

- Core continuity rules;
- Light Mode guidance;
- Specialist Mode routing;
- reference router;
- task cards;
- memory discipline;
- adoption and greenfield setup;
- quality and QA gates;
- R&D idea loop;
- self-improvement reflexes.

The skill is the executable protocol. The docs explain it, but the skill is what agents should follow.

## Updating The Skill

When the skill changes, update the installed copy:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.codex/skills/jarvis-os
cp -R codex-skill/jarvis-os ~/.codex/skills/jarvis-os
```

If an old chat is still active, use a workflow refresh prompt:

```text
Jarvis, workflow refresh.

Use JARVIS OS Specialist Mode.
Read the latest installed JARVIS OS skill and the live project state.
Continue from the next unblocked task using the latest workflow rules.
```
