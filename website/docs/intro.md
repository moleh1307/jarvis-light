# JARVIS OS

JARVIS OS is a local-first operating system for Codex continuity. It turns a normal repository or workspace into a durable memory layer for agent work.

The core idea is simple:

```text
chat = temporary working surface
markdown = durable continuity layer
```

Instead of asking an agent to remember a long conversation forever, JARVIS OS teaches the agent to retrieve the right files, do the work, verify outputs, and leave the smallest useful trace for the next session.

Invoke JARVIS OS once; the agent should route the right features by relevance. Small work stays light, serious work can activate Specialist Mode, scattered context can trigger a Work Pack, and public changes can trigger validation and release checks.

Short prompts are fine. If intent is unclear in a way that would change the work, the agent should ask a compact follow-up instead of guessing.

If the user only invokes JARVIS OS with no task, mode, project, or target, the agent should not silently choose. It should briefly explain JARVIS Core / Light Mode and JARVIS Specialist Mode, then ask which mode to use.

Long chats can drift as context grows. The Runtime Anchor is a one-screen refresh note agents should reload after compaction, repeated continuation, interruption, or before important closeout so they keep using the right JarvisOS features without reading the full skill again.

## What JARVIS OS Solves

Long agent projects usually fail in predictable ways:

- the chat becomes too long to reason through cleanly;
- context compaction loses subtle project state;
- a fresh chat starts from zero;
- decisions hide in old transcripts;
- generated artifacts become hard to trust;
- task status drifts across notes;
- agents forget why a workflow rule exists.

JARVIS OS moves those facts into markdown files that both humans and agents can inspect.

## The Two Layers

JARVIS OS has two operating layers.

| Layer | Use it for | What it adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JARVIS Core / Light Mode | Normal tasks and small project work | targeted retrieval, memory discipline, handoffs, artifact hygiene |
| JARVIS Specialist Mode | Serious, long-running, public, risky, or multi-discipline work | roles, task boards, work orders, review gates, operating modes, closeout checks |

Light Mode is the default. Specialist Mode is optional and should earn its complexity.

## What Makes It Different

JARVIS OS is not a background surveillance memory system. It does not require screenshots, an always-on recorder, a hidden vector database, or transcript dumping.

It is intentionally inspectable:

- markdown is canonical;
- memory writes are explicit;
- decisions have homes;
- artifacts have status and verification;
- self-improvement is governed by candidate, repeated, promoted, rejected, and superseded lanes.

## The Outcome Contract

A JARVIS OS session succeeds when Codex can:

1. recover the relevant durable context;
2. complete the user's actual task;
3. verify meaningful outputs;
4. update only the memory that future work needs;
5. leave the next session in a clearer state.

The goal is not more ceremony. The goal is continuity without confusion.
