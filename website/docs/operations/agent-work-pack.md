# Agent Work Pack

An Agent Work Pack is a temporary task-local mission packet for meaningful JarvisOS work.

It gives the current agent one compact brief:

- what the task is;
- which mode and role apply;
- what to read first;
- what not to read unless needed;
- which tools and permissions matter;
- which important assumptions are being carried;
- what output is expected;
- what the finished output should look and feel like;
- what verification proves done;
- where durable memory should be updated.

It is designed to reduce agent cognitive load. It is not a second task board, not a new permanent state file, and not required for tiny Light Mode work.

## When To Use It

Use a Work Pack when:

- starting a serious Specialist Mode task;
- resuming after a fresh chat, compaction, or interruption;
- onboarding a new agent to a complex project;
- context is scattered across current state, task board, work order, references, skills, and tools;
- a task has meaningful verification or privacy boundaries.

Skip it for:

- one-command answers;
- tiny edits;
- simple Light Mode questions;
- tasks where the work order already contains everything needed.

## Lifecycle

Default lifecycle: temporary.

At closeout, the Work Pack should expire. Promote only durable facts into:

- a work order;
- current state;
- handoff;
- project memory;
- decision log;
- artifact note.

## Good Work Pack

A good Work Pack fits on one screen when possible, names exact files, prevents over-reading, states stop/ask triggers, and makes done criteria observable.

For meaningful deliverables, it also names the Done Shape before implementation: who the result is for, what form the final artifact takes, what must be visible, what it must not become, and what quality feel the team is aiming for.

It should also expose consequential assumptions instead of hiding them in confident prose. Record only assumptions that could affect outcome, scope, privacy, cost, or verification; low-risk ordinary guesses do not need a row.

## Bad Work Pack

A bad Work Pack duplicates the whole work order, lists every JarvisOS rule, becomes another current-state file, or is created for every tiny task.

Bad Done Shape is vague decoration like "make it professional." Useful Done Shape is concrete enough to guide implementation and review.

Bad Assumption Ledger lists obvious facts or turns every minor unknown into a blocker. Useful Assumption Ledger says what is being assumed, why it is acceptable for now, and when to revisit.
