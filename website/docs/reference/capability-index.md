# Capability Index

This page is a map, not a new workflow. Use it when you want to know what JARVIS OS can do and where to look next.

JarvisOS agents should apply these capabilities by relevance. The user should not need to name every internal feature; the agent chooses the smallest useful set for the task.

| Capability | Use it when | Primary trigger | Where to read |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Relevance-First Auto-Routing | JARVIS OS is invoked and the agent must choose which features apply. | `Jarvis, use JARVIS OS` | this page, [Reference Router](../operations/reference-router.md) |
| Light Mode | The task is small, local, or self-contained. | `Jarvis, use JARVIS OS` | [Light Mode](../modes/light-mode.md) |
| Specialist Mode | The project needs roles, work orders, durable state, review, or release discipline. | `Jarvis, use JARVIS OS Specialist Mode` | [Specialist Mode](../modes/specialist-mode.md) |
| Mode Exit Ramp | Specialist Mode work is closed and the next task can be lighter. | closeout after serious work | [Light Mode](../modes/light-mode.md), [Specialist Mode](../modes/specialist-mode.md) |
| Command Deck | You want short invocation phrases instead of long prompts. | `status`, `continue`, `new idea` | [Prompt Library](prompt-library.md) |
| Clarifying Follow-Up Gate | A short/vague request would change implementation depending on interpretation. | `change this`, `fix it`, `make it better` | [Checklists](checklists.md) |
| Referent Snapshot | The request says `this`, `that`, `it`, `here`, or similar and the target must be identified. | vague target words | [Checklists](checklists.md) |
| Clarification Receipt | The user answers a follow-up with a terse reply that must bind back to the pending question. | `yes`, `go`, `second`, `that one` | [Checklists](checklists.md) |
| Accidental Message Guard | A prior message was wrong, accidental, or cancelled. | `ignore previous`, `cancel that` | [Prompt Library](prompt-library.md) |
| Fresh-Chat Handoff | A chat is getting long or another session needs to continue. | `fresh-chat handoff` | [Fresh Chat](../getting-started/fresh-chat.md), [Handoffs](../concepts/handoffs.md) |
| Artifact Hygiene | Files, docs, images, data, PDFs, or generated outputs need trust labels and verification. | any meaningful artifact | [Artifact Hygiene](../concepts/artifact-hygiene.md) |
| Context Freshness Badge | A task relies on memory, state files, git status, public versions, blockers, dates, or mutable external facts. | stale-risk context | [Checklists](checklists.md) |
| Verification Breadcrumb | A result, artifact, version, build, test, dashboard, or public claim was verified and future agents may need to trust or rerun it. | `verified`, `tests passed`, `ready` | [Checklists](checklists.md) |
| Reference Router | Several workflow references could apply and the agent should not over-read. | complex routing | [Reference Router](../operations/reference-router.md) |
| Agent Work Pack | A meaningful task has scattered context, tools, constraints, and done criteria. | `create a Work Pack` | [Agent Work Pack](../operations/agent-work-pack.md) |
| Done Shape | A deliverable needs a clear target before implementation. | meaningful deliverable Work Pack | [Agent Work Pack](../operations/agent-work-pack.md) |
| Assumption Ledger | A Work Pack needs to carry consequential assumptions without blocking execution. | meaningful Work Pack with uncertainty | [Agent Work Pack](../operations/agent-work-pack.md) |
| Skill Composition | Multiple skills apply and the lead/support boundary is unclear. | named or overlapping skills | [Skill Composition](../operations/skill-composition.md) |
| Task Lifecycle | A Specialist Mode work order needs state, risk, evidence, blockers, or closeout. | work order change | [Task Lifecycle](../operations/task-lifecycle.md) |
| Quality Gates | Output needs critique, verification, or closeout integrity. | QA/review/readiness | [Quality Gates](../operations/quality-gates.md) |
| Public Artifact Framing | A README, public page, bio, landing page, email, or simple site will be judged externally. | public-facing artifact | [Public Artifacts](../operations/public-artifacts.md) |
| R&D Idea Loop | A team is improving a product, workflow, or JarvisOS itself idea by idea. | `new idea` | [R&D Loop](../modes/rd-loop.md) |
| Dogfood Return Check | A new R&D loop starts and the last feature may have produced evidence. | start of `new idea` loop | [R&D Loop](../modes/rd-loop.md) |
| Cross-Project Contribution | Another JarvisOS chat finds a reusable workflow or skill candidate. | `JarvisOS Skill Ticket` | [Cross-Project Contributions](../operations/cross-project-contributions.md) |
| Skill Quality Standard | A JarvisOS skill or skillset needs to be detailed, reusable, and verifiable. | skill creation/review | [Skill Quality Standard](../operations/skill-quality-standard.md) |
| Self-Improvement | A repeated friction pattern should become a candidate, not a silent rule. | learning/reflex signal | [Self-Improvement](../concepts/self-improvement.md) |
| Jarvis Doctor | Public template changes need structural validation before commit/push. | `python3 tools/jarvis-doctor.py` | [Jarvis Doctor](../operations/jarvis-doctor.md) |
| Release Readiness | A public repo, version, changelog, or deployment is being prepared. | `release readiness` | [Release and GitHub Pages](../operations/release-and-github-pages.md) |

## Choosing Quickly

- Apply features by relevance; do not wait for the user to name every feature.
- Start with Light Mode unless the task earns Specialist Mode.
- Use Specialist Mode when state, roles, review, release risk, or long-running continuity matter.
- Use the Command Deck for short invocations.
- Use the Reference Router when several docs could apply.
- Use a Work Pack when execution context is scattered.
- Use Jarvis Doctor before public template commits.

## What This Is Not

The Capability Index is not an automation layer, hidden command parser, or replacement for judgment. It is a map of the existing JarvisOS surfaces.
