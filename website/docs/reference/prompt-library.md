# Prompt Library

## Normal Continuity

```text

Read the relevant project memory first, then help me with:
...
```

## Fresh-Chat Handoff

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS OS.

This chat is getting long. Create a fresh-chat handoff for this project.
Include current objective, completed work, blockers, exact next steps,
and files the next chat should read first.
```

## Workflow Refresh

```text

Read the latest installed JARVIS OS skill and the live project state.
Continue from the next unblocked task using the latest workflow rules.
```

## JarvisOS Skill Ticket

Short command:

```text
JarvisOS Skill Ticket
```

Expanded command:

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS OS.

Create a JarvisOS Skill Ticket from this chat.
Review the available chat history, project memory, decisions, artifacts,
repeated workflows, prompts, tools, and failure modes.

Create a detailed skill ticket with:
- ticket ID;
- source evidence;
- reusable pattern;
- proposed skill or skillset;
- detailed skill draft with ownership boundary, delegation boundary,
  hard boundaries, workflow, repair path, outputs, and verification;
- privacy lane;
- what stays project-local;
- anti-bloat review;
- suggested implementation path;
- verification plan;
- R&D handoff prompt.

Save it under company/skill-tickets/ if that vault is available.
Otherwise print the full ticket in chat.
Do not implement it here.
```

## Skillset Extraction

```text
Jarvis, use JARVIS OS.

Review this chat's available history, project memory, decisions, artifacts,
repeated workflows, prompts, tools, and failure modes.
Use the Cross-Project Contribution Bridge to propose a JarvisOS skill or
skillset based on what became reusable here.

For each proposed skill, include:
- name;
- trigger conditions;
- non-triggers;
- ownership boundary;
- delegation boundary;
- hard boundaries;
- reusable workflow;
- repair or fallback workflow;
- required inputs/tools;
- output artifacts and provenance;
- verification checks and acceptance criteria;
- privacy boundary;
- examples;
- recommendation: create-skill, merge-into-existing-skill,
  keep-as-project-memory, make-template, or reject.

Do not install or publish anything yet. Package the result as a JarvisOS
Skill Ticket for R&D.
```
